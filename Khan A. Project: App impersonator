/* What does the app's SQL look like?
Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores,
an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.*/

CREATE table TikTok (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    category TEXT,
    minutes INTEGER);
INSERT into TikTok (category,minutes) VALUES ('Cooking', '3');
INSERT into TikTok (category,minutes) VALUES ('Crafts', '1');
INSERT into TikTok (category,minutes) VALUES ('Things to do','2');
INSERT into TikTok (category,minutes) VALUES ('funny videos', '2');

UPDATE TikTok set category = "funny animal videos" 
WHERE id = 4;


DELETE FROM TikTok
WHERE id = 2;
